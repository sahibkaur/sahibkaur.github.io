Hello,

Today was a lovely day. It wasn't so productive, but I still managed to work on some of tasks that were blockedn - which felt good.

In the evening, I wasn't even working but I was just sitting in front of the screen. Then, I pushed myself to go out - I grabbed the book "Animal Farm by George Oswell" and went out. I was about to start it then our dog Bruzzo got into a fight with the street dog, which had apparently slipped his way under our car. Later, my sister saw that our dog got a lil' cut. So, she asked me to wash him and take his place. I poured water on him, brushed his hair. What motivated me to do it was - I mentioned to didi (my elder sister) that I want a horse, I'll have one in future; she reminded me that I don't even take care of our dog. That hurt because it was true. Hence, here I was - bathing him, combing his hair. Also, we have a dairy farm, so he was tied alongside a calf. I reached my hand out to the calf and tried to strom him but he budged, so, I thought I am going to make him my friend now. I grabbed a grass branch (is it called that?), and fed him. I thought I'll keep doing it, and let's see if the calf lets me pat him over time.

Fast forward to 8pm, I had a call with the 6-week trainees for their evaluation call. The call went well, it's so good to see the trainees learn so much and grow from a small even-odd project to a full Netflix clone.
I am talking about the training program at ![Ryaz.io](https://www.ryaz.io/) and I am the training lead there. So, I handle the management stuff.

Later, I had a call with Inder. As I said, I am about to start my UI/UX journey. Today was the introductory call with him. And here's what he taught me:

1. We can learn design using many ways. Mainly it is two ways:
   Either learn the rules first and then get into design.
   Or start tinkering with Figma and keep learning as you go.
   The first method is his method. We'll start with that first, let's see it works for me.
2. In design, usually it comes to 'what looks good' and 'what is right'. Always choose 'what is right', later you can make that look good.
3. 'what is right' comprises of rules. So, in order to be able to break the rules, you should be aware of them. But don't be afraid to break rules, because in art - you cannot confine yourself.
   Inder gave example of this as: We tell a child not to go to the road, then when he learns how to break to rule by learning how to walk on the sides of it, and later learns how to break the rule by eventually walking on the road when it is safe.
4. What makes something look good is Symmetry and Association.
   Symmetry makes something look good universally, because generally symmetrical things look good. But association is what generates emotions in the viewer. In order to work on association of the design, we won't study the crowd, we'll only need to understand one person.

First, we began with Symmetry. Inder asked me the question:

````A webpage consists mostly of:
A. Text
B. Images
C. Videos
D. Colors```

The answer is `A.Text`. Because the change in text plays a major role in the whole design of the webpage or appearance of it.

For that we started with the concept of Typography, and my first task/homework was to study typography in detail from this [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20161015175942/http://www.thinkingwithtype.com/).
Starting from Letter, moving on to Text, then Grid and then Extras.

I am excited to start this. I'll get back to you regarding this tomorrow.
Also, yes I meditated today as well. But I couldn't concentrate that much but it was good.

Toodles
