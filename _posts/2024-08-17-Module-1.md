Hello hellu,

Next task was to study for [this certification cours](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-ux-design#courses) on Coursera.

In module 1, here are the notes for "Get to know user experience design.

- User experience: How a person, the user feels about interacting with, or experiencing, a product.
- A product is a good, service or a feature.
- For a user to have good experience, the product needs to be:
  **Usable**: For example, one user might find an app with a lot of text easy to use. On the other hand, a user with a visual impairment might want different features like sound.
  **Equitable**: Being equitable means your designs are useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities and backgrounds.
  **Enjoyable**: Think about ordering takeout food online. When you search for a restaurant in Google or Yelp, you can see photos of dishes and read reviews from other people who have eaten there. This experience is enjoyable because you can make a more informed choice about what to order, leaving you feeling happier about the product.
  **Useful**: For example, if you're lost, a map app telling you how to get home is useful. But if the app can't find your current location, it's not so useful anymore.

- UX designers are empathatic too. Empathy is the ability to understand someone else's feelings or thoughts in a situation.

- Many different types of UX designers:
  - **Interation designer**: Focus on designing the experience of a product and how it functions.
  - **Visual designer**: Focus on how a product or technology looks.
  - **Motion designer**: They think about what it feels like for a user to move through a product.
  - **Graphic designer**: Focus on physical appearance of a product.
  - **UX designer**: Focus on how user interacts with a product.

Collagues of a UX designer:

- UX researcher

- Production designer
- UX engineer
- UX program managers

Will continue the rest tomorrow.
