Heloo people!!
I worked on rest of the components. Only 4 of them are pending, which I will work on tomorrow. Since I haven't assembled the components, there's no visible output to show but here's the [link to the code](https://github.com/sahibkaur/course-demo).

Here's the [latest commit](https://github.com/sahibkaur/course-demo/commit/f125fbb79594dd0a52af4ab7d416d76711d5da6a).

Tomorrow I will show the final output.
I am aiming to write blog everyday. Even on days I don't code. The reason behind it is because this will help me with habit and accountability. Since each day I have to write the blog, wouldn't it be embarassing when I haven't done much work. So to save myself from my own embarassment, I would put in more effort. Here's to a daily blog.
Cheers!

See ya tomorrow.
Toodles!
