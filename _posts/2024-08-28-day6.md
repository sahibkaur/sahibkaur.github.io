Hello hellu,

Today I worked on codewizards and finalised the wireframes after Khushboo and Uttam's feedback.

And Sapan didi bought a car. It is such a huge achievement that a woman in our household bought a car.
Here's her beautiful smile:

I also taked to Simran (my best friend) today. She is getting married in December - I am so glad that her wedding date doesn't clash with the my cousin's wedding and Panda's wedding.

December is going to be awesome.

Yesterday's message from the universe.
