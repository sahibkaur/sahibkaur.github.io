I did yoga and I meditated too. I have written down the SOD for today, which is:

- Continue the ![Foundations of User Experience (UX) Design course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-user-experience-design/).
- Write Blog
- Apply for Jobs
- Study Typoraphy, Color Theory, Grids, Spacing.
- Analyze 5 top UI designs on Dribbble/Behance (take notes on patterns).
- Recreate 1 UI screen for practive in Figma.

I am going to continue the course now.

Toodles,
Sahib
