Heloo people!!
Yesterday I started the Mosh Course given by my mentor Divyanshu. I completed the HTML and CSS Basics part and here are my notes:

Notes:

HTML(Markup Language), CSS(Styling Language) are used for basic building blocks. JavaScript is a programming language, which helps to define what to do.

<a href=“img.jpg” download>my photo</a> This attribute directly downloads the image when I click on the hyperlink text.

target=“_blank” to open the link in next tab.
href=“mailto:sahibkaur81@gmail” Opens mail client with email id already mentioned in “to”.

Object-fit:cover;
It crops to fit the image in the container. Helps to maitain aspect-ratio of the image. Because if we add width and height to an image, it can resize to stretch or squish the image.

Autoplay atrribute: video automatically starts when page is loaded.
Loop attribute: videos loops.
Controls: you can see controls on the video
Add fallback text if your browser doesn’t support videos.

border-collapse: collapse;
Collapses the border for table.

Select the text, then use Alt + up/down arrows to move the code up or down in the VS code editor.

Semantic elements:
- Article
- Figure
- Mark


Pseudo elements
```P::first-letter {
}```

```P::selection {
}```

```P::first-line {
}```

The above pseudo selectors are used to style a specific parts of the given tag or selector.

I am supposed to complete this course by tomorrow. I am trying my best but I had work in the other project due to which I couldn't start the task earlier. I hope to complete most of it.

On a separate note, yesterday I had still yet to work on my task but I was so tired by 9:30pm, I slept early. I woke up around 2 am and worked till 5 am. And then slept again. I think this technique works well.

On a personal note, things haven't been so smooth lately. I little cloudy over here, but it is always darkest before the dawn, isn't it?

See ya tomorrow.
Toodles!
