Heyoo!!
Welcome to my training journey for my final semester of MCA at [Panjab University ](https://puchd.ac.in/). Although my training started a week back but because of some health issues and my inconsistency, I didn't write any blogpost to track my tasks' progress. 

I have started my training here at [Ryaz.io](https://www.ryaz.io/), under my mentor [Divyanshu Garg aka Luci](https://www.instagram.com/divyanshugarg36/).

My first task is as follows:
https://react.dev/reference/react/use
Demonstrate each and every hook given in this documentation and give them a meaningful use case.

Till now, I have used the hook [useState](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState), and implemented in the project "hooks-demo". Here's the [commit](https://github.com/sahibkaur/demo-hooks/commit/a414a21fb1bb6eb4140781c2b510c4a46038011c]) demostrating the useState hook.

For today, I will:
- Deploy my project.
- Understand the useEffect hook.
- Demonstrate the useEffect hook and deploy it.
- Other hooks in queue are:
    - useMemo
    - useRef

It's already 9:08pm now, I am thinking of working of atleast 2:30 hours then I'll start learning tomorrow by 10:30. Before I go to sleep, I will write another blog noting down the progress made by the EOD. 

Also, my biggest enemy of all time is me being distrated easily. To tackle that I'll use the pomodoro technique using the [Tomato Timer](https://www.tomatotimers.com/).

I am really excited and pumped right now. See you in 3 hours.

Toodles!
