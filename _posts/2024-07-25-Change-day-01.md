I kept a promise to myself. I meditated today. I recently read the book "Breaking the Habit of Being Yourself" By Dr. Joe Dispenza. It is about how we can change our mind and in turn change our life. So, in the third section of this, Dr. Joe Dispenza shares mediations for 4 weeks. Each meditation needs to be done everyday for 1 week, then the meditation for the 2 week should be added to your daily routine along with the week 1 meditation and so on. The timing for meditation escalates from 20 mins in week 1 to 40 mins - 1 hour in week 4. It's a good rhythm to get into the habit of meditating, the benefit of which is mentioned in the book and has already been widespread.

I didn't keep my promise of doing Yoga though. But I hope keeping this habit of writing blogs will help me be accountable for it.

There is a wise man on this planet, who reminded me today that:
"Confidence is having an undeniable stack of proof of who you say you are."
So, this blog is going to be my proof to myself for who I am becoming.

Tomorrow, I am going to start my journey in the ocean of UI/UX. I am going to be the best designer and it is going to be epic from here on forth.

Toodles!
