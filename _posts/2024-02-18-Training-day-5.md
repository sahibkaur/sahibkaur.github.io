Heloo people!!

I completed the first part which included the HTML and CSS basics. Following are the notes and summary of what I learned.

- Class selector, Id selector
- hsl(52deg 61% 20%)
- 52deg gives the colour value, 61 gives saturation, 20 gives brightness, and another value for opaqueness

- Gradients are technically backgrounds.
- background: linear-gradient(45deg dodgerblue, yellow, 90%)
- Radial-gradient(circle at top, white, yellow)
- [Cssgradient.io](https://cssgradient.io/) to create gradients.

- In VSCode, we can see the specificity of a rule by hovering our mouse over it. The
specificity is represented using three numbers (x, y, z) where x represents the number of
ID selectors, y represents the number of class/attribute selectors and z represents the
number of element selectors.

Then, I started the part 2. In which I revised the layout part - which included box-model, sizing-elements, overflowing, measuring units, positioning using relative and absolute values.

I will complete part 2, 3 tomorrow.


See ya tomorrow.
Toodles!
