I meditated, did yoga and completed the book - The Compound Effect. But I didn't work on any learning task.

Things I am proud of:

- I meditated and did yoga.

Things I need to improve on:

- I have got to build up my work ethic.

Working/learning hours: 0.

This 100 days of change, I want the streak of 100 days of meditating and yoga at least. I will keep adding the things I want to keep doing for the 100 days.

Toodles,
Sahib
