Heloo people!!

I completed the Control flow part of the course. There were a few exercises in the end to practice what I learned in the course do far.

It was fun, but I didn't complete the whole course which I am aiming to do tomorrow.
I got three parts left:

- Objects [2:30 hours]
- Arrays [2:30 hours]
- Functions [2:30 hours]

I will track hours for each part, let's see how much do I stick to it.

See you tomorrow.

Byeee!
