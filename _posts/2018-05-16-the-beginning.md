Heyoo!!
Welcome welcome to the first ever blog of my learning journey. Although I have been in training for over a week now but I couldn't setup my blog for a number of reasons. I always got stuck, because of some issue and then I would shift to a different theme. The more complex theme, the more issues. Then Aman recommended me Jaswant's blog about setting up blog on Github pages [https://jaswantsinghh.github.io/BlogTalks//blog]. And it worked wonders for me, I chose a very simple and cool theme, and just went with it.

About my training, my first task was to complete the frontend mentor task [https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/tip-calculator-app-ugJNGbJUX
]. I am still working on it to make it perfect! There's a long way to go. I will write more about it in my blog tomorrow, explaining the current problem and if I came up with a solution to it.

Very important thing here that my mentor is none other than Mandyyyy. It's been a very goood week of learning and I am more than excited about what more I am going to learn in the journey. 
See you tomorrow then!
Toodles.
