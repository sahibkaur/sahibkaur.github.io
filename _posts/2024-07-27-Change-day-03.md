Hello,

Today I relaxed and worked on my training task. I didn't work much because there were a few electricity cuts due to that I was so irritated most of the day.

I met my school friends today. My friend who just got married last year, called me and asked if we can meet for some time. She called our other friend, who completes our trio. We met, ate and chatted for half hour max. She and her husband had to leave early.

Anyways, I also painted a few clay fridge magnet I tried last night. They are yet to be finished, I'll show the images tomorrow.

In the design task, I learnt about analogy of text.

[This documentation](https://web.archive.org/web/20161011001342/http://www.thinkingwithtype.com/contents/letter/#Anatomy) is insightful.

Today, I was watching [a video](https://youtu.be/KoO3iiYHQC8?si=5O6iuVRyZOidV6se) about how they butchered the use of magic in Doctor Strange: Multiverse of Madness, while I was painting those clay magnets. Honestly, I loved the first part much better. In this video, they mentioned how it is important to set a rule of magic for the character. As in the beginning of the video they say "Go deeper into a magic instead of wider.". What they meant was rather than the character having a ton of powers, even if they have just one, they should go deeper into it. Meaning how the character can use those powers in different circumstances.
In Doctor Stranger 2, Wanda Vision had so many different types of powers, where she used a few in some circumstances, and didn't use those in the other similar cases where they would have been more useful.
To validate their point, they gave the example of Magneto [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoO3iiYHQC8&t=2049s0), how Magneto had the power to control metal, so he was captured in plastic cage. And anyone who has to go inside had to go through the metal detector. In order to help Magneto escape, one of his accomplice injected something metallic into a gaurd via an injection. Since, it wouldn't kill the gaurd directly but it could be passed through the metal detector. So, when the gaurd was in front of Magneto, he extracted the metal out of the gaurd using his power and used it to escape.

Now, here the writer had established a rule to later break it carefully.

As mentioned in yesterday's blog, it is important to learn rules, which you should definitely break from day one - because creativity cannot be contained in rules. But you must be aware of the rules in order to break them.

Another example the video gave was about the Gandalf scene, where he makes the swords in opponents hand go hot, making them drop those weapons. But he didn't use this power in any of the other movies of the triology. So, even if they had to show that he can't use this particular
power, they should have established the rule first. For example, the opponents used a special metal or whatever.

This video gave an insight of how much the study of what you are learning is important. You should know all the corners of your topic.

Also, I don't know anything about the movies with Magneto and Gandalf. I used the examples given in the video.

Later, I finished a task I received a month back but I was stuck on the design. Since I have just started learning design, I couldn't complete the one I was supposed to deliver along with the developed site. So, one of my friends at Ryaz.io, who is also helping me in my design training, mentioned that I shouldn't abandon my project and just deliver it however I can. He suggested to use [Webflow](https://webflow.com/) and get it done with. I deliverd my work just 20 minutes ago. Let's see how it goes.

Last but not the least, I meditated today as well.

Toodles!
