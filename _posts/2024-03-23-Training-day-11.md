Heloo people!!
I worked on putting together a few components, commencing the end of the Part 3 of the series.

Here's the [latest commit](https://github.com/sahibkaur/course-demo/commit/831ec7108eab0fdcc9ea3b1c1663bc30ce245d9d).

Here's the ![output](../images/output-day11.png)

I will start the next part JavaScript Basic to Beginners tomorrow. I will complete putting together the above components later on since I am already behind on the JavaScript work. I am seriously aiming on complete the whole part tomorrow itself.

A promise to myself I am going to keep.

See ya tomorrow.
Toodles!
