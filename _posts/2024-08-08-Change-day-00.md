Hello hellu,

I couldn't work properly after 2nd August. I am going to start the meditation streak again though.

For meditation:
As I am supposed to complete the week 1 meditation first. I did do it earlier but since I wasn't well, I didn't meditate for a few days. I know I should have showed up regardless but I'll be better now. I'll start with the week 1 meditation again. From next week Thurday [14th August 2024], I'll go for week 2 meditation.

For Design Learning:
As I was supposed to complete the type crimes, here's what I did:

`Here I was trying to see how the ascender height is greater than the cap height.
![Type crime 1](../images/aug/type-crime-1.png)

I will mention all the type crimes in a separate blog.

I had a call with Inder today, he reviewed my task - found some errors. And next, I am supposed to read all the remaining type crimes.

I am going to mark this blogpost as Day 0. A new start for the streak since I broke one last time.

Toodles Doodles.
