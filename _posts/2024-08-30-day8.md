Reading [this blog](https://webflow.com/blog/visual-hierarchy)
Visual Hierarchy is one of the four pillars of visual design principles, along with space, contrast, and scale. If any of your pages have a high bounce rate, a poorly executed visual hierarchy might be why.

1. Reading patterns
   There are two primary reading layouts: Z pattern and F pattern.
2. Rule of thirds
3. Size and Scale
4. Typography
5. Color and Contrast
6. White space
7. Proximity and repetition
