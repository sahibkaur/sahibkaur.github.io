In lesson 0, I watched [this documentary](https://documentaryheaven.com/objectified/)

"Good Design is Obvious, Great Design is Transparent"
"Designers understand people need more than they think they do"
I still haven't finished the entire documentary yet. [Here's](https://dribbble.com/shots/26242667-Think-Design-Repeat) what I illustrated today.

While watching the documentary, I got two ideas for My Youtube.

- Youtube, it was designed by Apple.
- Youtube, it was designed by Discord.

Toodles,
