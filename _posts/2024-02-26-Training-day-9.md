Heloo people!!
I have been working on the part 3. Here we learn about the best practices of creating a website while doing the hands on work.

Extensions installed on VS code
HTML CSS Support - helps to complete class and id attributes.
CSS Peek - helps to peek into the particular class/id CSS properties we defined in our CSS file.
Prettier - helps to format code
Highlight matching - helps to highlight the matching tag

Sprite cons code doesn’t work.
It says Xlink:href is deprecated but it doesn’t work at all.

<span class="icon-container">
    <svg class="icon icon--primary">
        <use href="images/sprite.svg#clock"></use>
    </svg>
</span>

I didn’t find any working solution on the internet.

Bottom Up approach - Design the components first and then combine them.
Top Down approach - Page first.

See ya tomorrow.
Toodles!
